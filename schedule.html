  <p>These are the classes that I am taking this semester</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Intro to Computer Science</li>
      <li>Paideia</li>
      <li>Web Fundamentals</li>
      <li>Intro to Biblical Studies</li>
      <li>Fitness and Wellness</li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  
  <p>January Term I plan on taking the course "It's a Conspiracy" or possible "Why You Took this Course".</p>
  
  <p>Spring Semester I am planning on taking these classes:</p>
  <ul>
      <li>Algorithims and Data Structures</li>
      <li>Paidiea</li>
      <li>Introduction to Philosophy</li>
      <li>Crime and Deviance</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I might double up with another computer science course and drop the Philosophy class, but I haven't decided if that's a good idea/if I should do it. Possibly taking CS 140 if it's available.</p>
